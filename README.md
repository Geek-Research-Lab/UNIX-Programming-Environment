Welcome to UNIX-Programming-Environment repository! <br>
In this repository, the programs that can be run on UNIX environment is coded here. <br>
Unix-BSD has been targeted. The project is intended for self-learning and also, aimed to do proposed thingy with windows.
<br>
And i wanna confess that i have no runnable BSD OS or anything.
<br>
I just have a cute Windows 8.1.1 Operating System. <br>
I've started coding these existing shits & hoping to build a tool for it soon.
<br>
And yes, I will be building one soon because i have been writing about it all time for a long time.
